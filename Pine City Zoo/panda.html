              <h3>PANDA</h3>
              <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long.</p>
              <p>The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. </p>
              <p>Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.</p>
              <p>As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>
              <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>Pandas are found in remote, mountainous regions in central China.</p>
