              <h3>GORILLA</h3>
              <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous,[1] terrestrial great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. T</p>
              <p>The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees.</p>
              <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 m (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and 270 kg (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in), depending on species and sex. </p>
              <p>Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years in the wild.</p>
              <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>Gorillas, the largest of the great apes, live in the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The habitat of the two species of gorilla, the eastern and western gorillas, is divided by almost 900km (560miles).</p>
